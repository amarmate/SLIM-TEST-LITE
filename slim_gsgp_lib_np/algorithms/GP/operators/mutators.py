def mutate_tree_node(max_depth, TERMINALS, CONSTANTS, FUNCTIONS, p_c):
    """
    Generates a function for mutating a node within a tree representation based on a set of
    terminals, constants, and functions.

    This function returns another function that can mutate a specific node in the tree representation.
    The mutation process involves randomly choosing between modifying a terminal, constant, or function node,
    while ensuring the resulting tree representation maintains valid arity (i.e., the number of child nodes
    expected by the function node).

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_depth : int
        Maximum depth of the tree to consider during mutation.
    TERMINALS : dict
        Dictionary of terminal symbols allowed in the tree.
    CONSTANTS : dict
        Dictionary of constant values allowed in the tree.
    FUNCTIONS : dict
        Dictionary of functions allowed in the tree.
    p_c : float
        Probability of choosing a constant node for mutation.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A function ('m_tn') that performs subtree mutation within a tree representation.

        expected by the function node). Depending on the maximum depth of the tree or the size of the original, the
        mutation process may only return a single node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tree : tuple
            The tree representation to mutate.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            The structure of the mutated tree representation.
        str
            The node resulting from mutation

    Notes
    -----
    The returned function (`m_tn`) operates recursively to traverse the tree representation and
