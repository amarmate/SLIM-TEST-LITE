#     Returns a function that performs subtree crossover between two individuals, enforcing a maximum depth.
    
#     The operator uses the following rules:
#     - If both individuals are trees (tuples), randomly select a branch
#         in each and swap them.
#     - If one individual is a terminal (non-tuple) and the other is a tree,
#         randomly select a branch from the tree, graft the terminal into that spot,
#         and return the removed branch as the other offspring.
#     - If both individuals are terminals, no crossover is performed.
